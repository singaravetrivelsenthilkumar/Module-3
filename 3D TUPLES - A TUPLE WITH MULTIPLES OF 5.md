## TUPLES - A TUPLE WITH MULTIPLES OF 5

---

### AIM  
To write a Python program to create a tuple containing all multiples of 5 up to a given number **N**.

---

### ALGORITHM
1. Initialize an empty tuple tuple1.

2. Read integer a from user input.

3. Loop from 9 up to (but not including) a in steps of 9:

4. In each iteration, append the current number i to tuple1.

5. Print the final tuple1.

6. Print the length of tuple1.


---

### PROGRAM
REG No: 212222220048
NAME : SINGARAVETRIVEL S

```
tuple1=tuple()
a=int(input())
for i in range(9,a,9):
    tuple1=tuple1+(i,)
print(tuple1)
print("Length of the tuple is",len(tuple1))

```

### RESULT

Thus, the Python program to create a tuple containing all multiples of 9 up to a given number **N** is successfully verified.
